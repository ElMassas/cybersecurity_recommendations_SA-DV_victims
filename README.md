# Cybersecurity & privacy recommendations for domestic abuse and sexual assault victims

A lot of times the law isn't quick enough to support victims, and some victims are unfortunately stuck with their abusers.
This article is meant to be a guide for people working on leaving their abusers, and also for people helping the victims, whether they work for an ONG or a state entity.

At this moment, the article is deployed using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and can be viewed in this website: [Link](https://publish.obsidian.md/cybersecuritydomestivviolencevictims/Privacidade+e+seguran%C3%A7a+online+para+v%C3%ADtimas+de+viol%C3%AAncia+dom%C3%A9stica+e+abuso+sexual)

# Goals

1. This article is meant to be continuously updated with information and resources, as well translations to different languagues.
2. If possible the article should be context aware. A victim living in China will some different aspects to consider compared to someone living in France.
3. This article is not meant to be in an in-depth off-grid guide. For that there are other resources, and this article links to some more resources. This article is specifically for people who need to escape their abusers.
