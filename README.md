# Cybersecurity & privacy recommendations for domestic abuse and sexual assault victims

A lot of times the law isn't quick enough to support victims, and some victims are unfortunately stuck with their abusers.
This article is meant to be a guide for people working on leaving their abusers, and also for people helping the victims, whether they work for an ONG or a state entity.

At this moment, the article is deployed using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and can be viewed in this website: [Link](https://publish.obsidian.md/cybersecurity-dv-victims/Homepage)

# Goals

1. This article is meant to be continuously updated with information and resources, as well translations to different languages.
2. If possible the article should be context aware. A victim living in China will have some different aspects to consider compared to someone living in France.
3. This article is not meant to be in an in-depth off-grid guide. For that there are other resources, and this article links to some more resources which can help with that endeavor. This article is specifically for people who need to escape their abusers.
